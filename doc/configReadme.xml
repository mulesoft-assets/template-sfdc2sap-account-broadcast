This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online synchronization of accounts/customers from Salesforce to SAP.
Everytime there is a new account or a change in already existing one in Salesforce instance, the template will fetch it and send it as IDoc to SAP to update customer there.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided in Process and On Complete stages.
The integration is triggered by poll to Salesforce Accounts. New or modified accounts are passed to the batch as input.
In the batch the customer is fetched from SAP by its name. If it exists, its SAP Account Group is resolved against SAP.
If it doesn't exist, then new customer number is fetched from SAP. Afterwards every such account from Salesforce is sent to SAP in form of iDoc XML where it is asynchronously updated or created. 
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly.
**Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Before continue with the use of this Anypoint Template, you may want to check out this [Documentation Page](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/SAP+Connector#SAPConnector-EnablingYourStudioProjectforSAP), that will teach you how to work 
with SAP and Anypoint Studio.

## Disclaimer

This Anypoint template uses a few private Maven dependencies from Mulesoft in order to work. If you intend to run this template with Maven support, you need to add three extra dependencies for SAP to the pom.xml file.

This file is conformed by two Flows.
The first one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **query** flow and then executing the batch job process.
The second one we'll call it **query** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:
1. The integration is triggered by poll to Salesforce Accounts. New or modified accounts are passed to the batch as input.
2. During the Process stage, the customer is fetched from SAP by its name.
3. If customer exists, its SAP Account Group is resolved against SAP. If it doesn't exist, then new customer number is fetched from SAP. Afterwards every such account from Salesforce is sent to SAP in form of iDoc XML where it is asynchronously updated or created.
4. Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will log output statistics data into the console.
